      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

      <p>
        These Terms & Conditions apply to all purchases made directly from
        Mcdodo (UK) via this website. By placing an order, you agree to be bound
        by the terms set out below.
      </p>

      <h2>International Products</h2>
      <p>
        Some products may be supplied internationally and may differ from UK
        products in specifications, packaging, labelling, instructions, or
        compliance standards. It is your responsibility to ensure products are
        suitable for your intended use.
      </p>

      <h2>Products Sold by Other Suppliers</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms apply only to products purchased directly from Mcdodo (UK).
        We are not responsible for Mcdodo-branded products purchased from third
        parties or unauthorised resellers.
      </p>

      <h2>Customer Support</h2>
      <p>
        Our support team is available to assist with questions, feedback, or
        order-related enquiries. We may request your order number to verify
        purchases before providing support. Order numbers are included in your
        order confirmation email.
      </p>

      <h2>Duties & Taxes</h2>
      <p>
        Orders shipped outside the United Kingdom may be subject to import
        duties, customs fees, VAT, or other charges imposed by the destination
        country. These charges are the responsibility of the customer.
        International orders will not be refunded if delivery fails due to
        unpaid duties or taxes.
      </p>

      <h2>Making a Purchase</h2>
      <p>
        Orders are placed by adding items to your basket and completing checkout.
        We accept payments via card and supported digital wallets such as Apple
        Pay and Google Pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        Order confirmation confirms receipt of your order but does not constitute
        acceptance. A binding contract is formed once payment is successfully
        processed and the order is confirmed.
      </p>

      <h2>Product Use & Liability</h2>
      <p>
        Our products must be used strictly in accordance with their intended
        purpose and instructions. Mcdodo (UK) is not liable for damage to devices,
        vehicles, batteries, or other property resulting from misuse, improper
        installation, or use outside recommended guidelines.
      </p>

      <h2>Errors & Accuracy</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions
        relating to product information, pricing, availability, or promotions at
        any time, including after an order has been placed. Where required, we
        will contact you before proceeding with any changes.
      </p>

      <h2>Payment Security</h2>
      <p>
        Payments are processed securely via our payment providers. Mcdodo (UK)
        does not store or have access to full card details at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>Shipping & Delivery</h2>
      <p>
        UK orders qualify for free standard delivery unless stated otherwise.
        Expedited delivery options are available on eligible orders placed
        Monday to Thursday before 5pm (UK time). Orders placed after this time
        may not qualify for expedited delivery.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms & Conditions from time to time. The latest
        version will always be available on this page. Continued use of the
        website constitutes acceptance of any updates.
      </p>
